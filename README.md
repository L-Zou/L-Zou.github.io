### [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster: Logistic Regression](https://l-zou.github.io/titanic/titanic.html)

Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster is a prediction competition host on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). The goal of the competition is to use the given information on the passengers on the Titanic to build a predictive model to assess which types of passengers are more likely to survive. This project uses logistic regression to build a predicitive model and is implemented using R.
