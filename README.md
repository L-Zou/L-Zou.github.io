## Projects

### [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster: Logistic Regression](https://l-zou.github.io/titanic/titanic.html)

Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster is a prediction competition host on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). The goal of the competition is to use the given information on the passengers on the Titanic to build a predictive model to assess which types of passengers are more likely to survive. This project uses logistic regression to build a predicitive model and is implemented using R. 

## [Tableau Portfolio](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lily3153#!/)

Below are several Tableau Dashboards created using public datasets. Each tableau workbook is located in the ["workbook directory"](https://github.com/L-Zou/L-Zou.github.io/tree/main/workbook) in this repo. A preview of each dashboard is available below. Click each title to fully explore the interactive dashboards on tableau public. SQL queries were used to wrangle the datasets into a suitible form for analysis and visualization.

Dataset used: [vgsales](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales)

The dataset contains information on various video games released between 1980 and 2020 including the publishing company, genre, global sales, platform, Europe sales, Japan sales, and North American sales. Using the dataset I constructed a dashboard showing the top 10 video game publishers, top video game titles, and various metrics regarding global and regional sales.
