## Data Science Portfolio

This portfolio contains a compilation of data analysis projects created using R as well as some dashboards created using tableau and SQL queries.

## Projects

### [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster: Logistic Regression](https://l-zou.github.io/titanic/titanic.html)

Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster is a prediction competition hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). The goal of the competition is to use the given information on the passengers on the Titanic to build a predictive model to assess which types of passengers are more likely to survive. This project uses logistic regression to build a predicitive model and is implemented using R. 

### [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques: SVM and Random Forests](https://l-zou.github.io/house/house.html)

House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques is a prediction competition hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). The goal of the competition is to use the given information on residential homes in Iowa to build a predictive model for housing prices. This project uses SVM and Random Forests to build a predicitive model and is implemented using R.

## [Tableau Portfolio](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lily3153#!/)

Below are several Tableau Dashboards created using public datasets. Each tableau workbook is located in the ["workbook directory"](https://github.com/L-Zou/L-Zou.github.io/tree/main/workbook) of the L-Zou.github.io repo. A preview of each dashboard is available below. Click each title to fully explore the interactive dashboards on tableau public. SQL queries were used to wrangle the datasets into a suitible form for analysis and visualization. 

### [Video Game Sales](https://public.tableau.com/views/Book1_16240831851680/Dashboard2?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

Dataset used: [vgsales](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales)

[SQL Queries](https://github.com/L-Zou/L-Zou.github.io/blob/main/workbook/VideoGameSales/videogames.sql)

The dataset contains information on various video games released between 1980 and 2020 including the publishing company, genre, global sales, platform, Europe sales, Japan sales, and North American sales. Using the dataset I constructed a dashboard showing the top 10 video game publishers, top video game titles, and various metrics regarding global and regional sales. 

### [Netflix IMDB Scores](https://public.tableau.com/shared/NF5YYZ9SS?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

Dataset used: [NetflixOriginals](https://www.kaggle.com/luiscorter/netflix-original-films-imdb-scores)

[SQL Queries](https://github.com/L-Zou/L-Zou.github.io/blob/main/workbook/netflix/netflix.sql)

Since June 1st 2021, Netflix has released over 500 Netflix Originals on its platform. Consequently, choosing a Netflix Original to watch can be quite overwhelming. This dashboard aims to make the task of choosing a film to watch by organizing Netflix’s large catalogue of Originals by genre, language, runtime, and ranking said films using IMDb scores are a measure of quality. The dataset used contains information a Netflix's original genre, language, runtime, data of release, title, and IMDb score. Certain Netflix's originals had multiple genres (ex. teen romance). Using SQL queries such films were generalized into one genre (ex. romance). Additionally, originals with multiple languages were grouped under the category "multilingual" using SQL queries.
